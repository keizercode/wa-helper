# WA Helper

Just a simple web app to help you initiate and send the WhatsApp chat without saving the phone number.

## What I'm use here?

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the main tech stack and code base.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the CSS utility class tool.

## How to use it?

- Open
- You can insert the phone number that you want to send the message or just connect through WhatsApp.
- Click the "generate" button if you want to directly go to the WhatsApp app or click "copy link" if you just want to copy the generated url.
